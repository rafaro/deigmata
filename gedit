 # DEIGMATA
 
 **DEIGMATA** (DEIGMATA Enhances Interactive Graph Management And Traceable Analysis) is a research-driven project focused on enhancing the **visual exploration of knowledge graphs** through interactive and user-centered methodologies. As the volume and complexity of structured semantic data grow, interpreting and extracting meaningful insights from knowledge graphs becomes increasingly challenging. This project proposes a **methodological process** that leverages **exploratory visualization techniques** to improve interaction and facilitate insight generation.
